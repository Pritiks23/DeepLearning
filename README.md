PyTorch CIFAR-10 Image Classification Assignment

This assignment provides hands-on practice with PyTorch, a widely-used library for constructing deep learning models. Deep learning enables models to learn complex functions from data and has revolutionized areas like image recognition and speech processing.
The goal of this assignment is to build and evaluate a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Dataset: CIFAR-10

Size: 60,000 images

Classes: 10

Airplane

Automobile

Bird

Cat

Deer

Dog

Frog

Horse

Ship

Truck

Each image is a 32x32 color image.

By completing this assignment, you will practice:

Reading and understanding documentation for a modern machine learning library.

Writing PyTorch code for building and training neural networks.

Evaluating neural network models for accuracy and performance.

Improving model performance, such as through architecture adjustments, data augmentation, or optimization techniques.

Key Steps

Load and preprocess CIFAR-10 dataset

Normalize images

Split into training and test sets

Construct a neural network using PyTorch

Use modules such as nn.Conv2d, nn.Linear, and nn.ReLU

Define the forward pass

Train the model

Define a loss function (e.g., CrossEntropyLoss)

Use an optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD)

Track training and validation accuracy

Evaluate and visualize performance

Confusion matrices

Sample predictions

Accuracy/loss curves

Experiment with performance improvements

Deeper networks

Regularization (Dropout, weight decay)

Data augmentation
